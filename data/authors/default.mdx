I am a [slow thinker](https://sive.rs/slow), an introverted, and I love [rationality](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rationality), but also let my emotions guide and inspire me, when appropriate to the reality of the situation. I love to lose myself in thoughts and dreams, but also turning them into reality.

I have a deep passion for nature, exploring new places, challenging my limits, and uncovering novel experiences, always striving to achieve the perfect balance between embracing change and preserving constancy.

I'm a programmer, and I love creating and refining code that not only work seamlessly but also provide practical solutions to real-world challenges.
