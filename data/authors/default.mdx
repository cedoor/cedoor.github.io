I am a [slow thinker](https://sive.rs/slow) and an introvert, I love rationality, but I also let my emotions guide and inspire me, when suited to the reality of the situation. I love to get lost in thoughts and dreams but also turn them into reality.

I have a deep passion for nature, exploring new places, challenging my limits, and uncovering novel experiences, always striving to achieve the perfect balance between embracing change and preserving constancy.

I'm a programmer, and I love creating and refining code that not only works seamlessly but also provides practical solutions to real-world challenges.
