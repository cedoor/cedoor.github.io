I’m a [slow thinker](https://sive.rs/slow) and an introvert. I value rationality, yet I allow my emotions to guide and inspire me when they align with the reality of the moment. I often lose myself in thoughts and dreams, but I also strive to bring them to life.

I have a deep passion for nature, exploring new places, pushing my limits, and seeking out novel experiences. I’m always searching for the perfect balance between embracing change and preserving a sense of constancy.

I’m curious by nature. I love discovering new cultures and forming deep connections with people. I place great value on kindness, authenticity, and respect.
