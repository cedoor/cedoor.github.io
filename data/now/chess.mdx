A 64-square board with 32 pieces and a few dozen rules. This is what it takes to have one of the most complex and popular games in the world. Chess has always fascinated me, although I have never started playing it seriously. It was the surge in popularity over the last few years that finally motivated me to delve deeper into the game beyond the simple Scholar's Mate.

Constancy, dedication, strategic thinking, tactics and creativity are the main skills that one must master to play chess proficiently. And these skills, of course, are extremely useful outside chess too.

As of now, I have not followed any structured training plan. Instead, I have been playing a few daily freestyle games to start getting familiar.
