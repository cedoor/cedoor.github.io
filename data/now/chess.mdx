Chess has always fascinated me, although I have never started playing it seriously. It was the surge in popularity over the last few years that has finally motivated me to delve deeper into the game beyond the simple Scholar's Mate.

As of now, I have not followed any structured training plan yet. I have just been playing daily freestyle games to start getting familiar.
