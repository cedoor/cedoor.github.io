I have my morning routine: a glass of lukewarm water with lemon, stretching, 15 minutes of meditation and 5 Elevate games.

I started to plan my diet more carefully, less sugar, more vegetables and fruit.

I go swimming twice a week and run occasionally, but I like to experience various sports. I plan to compete in a cross triathlon by the end of 2023.
