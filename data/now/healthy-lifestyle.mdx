I have my morning routine: a glass of lukewarm water with lemon, stretching, 15 minutes of meditation and 10 minutes with Drops.

I started to plan my diet more carefully, less sugar, more vegetables and fruit.

I go running three times a week, and I like to experience various sports without a clear agenda.
