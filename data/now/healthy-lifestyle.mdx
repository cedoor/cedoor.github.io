I have my morning routine: a glass of lukewarm water with lemon, stretching, 15 minutes of meditation, 5 Elevate games and 5 minutes with Drops.

I started to plan my diet more carefully, less sugar, more vegetables and fruit.

I go swimming twice a week and running occasionally, and I like to experience various sports without a clear agenda. I've been thinking to compete in a triathlon in October though, in Rome, so I definitely need a well-defined plan.
