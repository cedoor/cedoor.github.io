I come from a very small country village ([Perdaxius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perdaxius)), surrounded by grassy fields and green hills.

I love nature, especially mountains, and I go hiking at least once a month when possible. I really enjoy going on long-distance hikes (days or even weeks).

My last hike was to Madeira ([gear](https://lighterpack.com/r/agb51e)).
