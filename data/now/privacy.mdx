I work as a software engineer on Open Source privacy and blockchain technologies. Programming is the activity that occupies most of the time in my life, and it is also what I love to do most.

Currently, I am focused on developer experience and studying more efficient data structures for [Semaphore](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/).
