My utmost priority is to achieve fluency in English. I still sound more stupid than when I speak in my native language, but I can finally see some progress.

I have been attending 2 lessons a week and writing my notes in English.

Hopefully, I'll start writing some articles in English in this blog as well.

I also started studying Portuguese with Duolingo.
